# Frontend Flask application for Webster Bank

The frontend consists of a Flask application with HTML views and a client for accessing the backend API. This app was designed to run **seperately** from the backend, which is why is is excluded from `docker-compose.yml`.

The frontend is deployed as an App Engine service in the `sentiment-test` project. The frontend has a backend API client that assumes the backend services are running on the `sentiment-prod` VM in the `sentiment-analysis` project (see [backend Quick start](/backend#Quick+start)). 

# Quick start

To run the frontend locally, run as a Flask server or as a gunicorn server.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run using Flask
python3 app.py
# OR run using gunicorn - used for production deployment
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 app:app
```

Visit `localhost:8080` in a browser to view the login page.

# Deployment

To deploy the application as an App Engine service, use the following command.

```bash
gcloud app deploy
```

The app deploys based on the configuration in `app.yaml`.
